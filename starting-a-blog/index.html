</ul>
<p>As a backend engineer with over a decade of experience,
I've spent countless hours diving deep into code, architecting systems, and solving complex problems.
But recently, I've felt a growing urge to step out of my comfort zone and embark on a new challenge: starting a blog.
In this post, I'll discuss my motivations for starting a blog and briefly explain my choice of tools: Zola and GitHub Pages.</p>
<h2 id="why-start-a-blog">Why start a blog?</h2>
<ul>
<li>
<p><strong>Preserving Knowledge across Roles</strong>: In my current and past roles I have tried to follow parts of the recommendations in
<a href="https://jmmv.dev/2021/04/always-be-quitting.html">Always be quitting</a> when it comes to documenting various aspects of my role.
The problem with this is that even when it's a generic explainer or How To this information is lost to me once I move roles.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Personal knowledge management</strong>: Memory is imperfect, and trying to find the same piece of information
you've already encountered can be frustrating, even in this brave new world of LLMs.
A blog can serve as a personal wiki or Zettelkasten system,
helping me organize and retrieve information more efficiently.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rubber_duck_debugging">Rubber duck debugging</a></strong><sup class="footnote-reference"><a href="#1">1</a></sup>: This technique for solving problems when
combined with posting the updates in Slack or Teams naturally leads to a set of useful
textual information, transforming this into a blog item that might help someone else or maybe more importantly my future self
facing the same problem again is an attactive proposition.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong><a href="https://www.complexsystemspodcast.com/">Complex Systems Podcast</a></strong>: I have recently been enjoying the podcast Complex Systems hosted by Patrick McKenzie (Patio11)
which in many of its episodes re-enforces the role of regular written communication and the benefits of it in
critical thinking and self-examination.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>"Show your workings"</strong>: During secondary school, it was drilled into me to always show my workings in mathematics and science.
The right answer wasn't always enough; demonstrating how you came to that answer was almost as important<sup class="footnote-reference"><a href="#2">2</a></sup>. While I didn't fully appreciate this at the time, I've found throughout my professional life that following this mantra has solved or prevented many problems from developing.</p>
<p>Blogging serves as an excellent platform for "showing my workings" in my professional context.
By writing about my problem-solving processes, architectural decisions, or even my learning journey,
I'm not just sharing the final solution but the entire thought process behind it. This approach offers several benefits:</p>
<ul>
<li>It helps me clarify my own thinking and often leads to new insights.</li>
<li>It provides a valuable resource for others who might be facing similar challenges.</li>
<li>It creates a record of my decision-making process, which can be incredibly useful when revisiting projects or defending choices later on.</li>
<li>It encourages a culture of transparency and knowledge-sharing within the tech community.</li>
</ul>
<p>By treating my blog as a place to "show my workings," I'm not just creating content – I'm cultivating a habit of thorough analysis and clear communication that will serve me well throughout my career.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="the-nuts-and-bolts">The nuts and bolts</h2>
<h3 id="why-zola">Why Zola?</h3>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://getzola.org">Zola</a> is written in Rust ⚡ which aligns well with my ongoing side project to improve my Rust proficiency. I'm actively seeking opportunities to apply and deepen my Rust knowledge, so Zola's Rust foundation was a significant factor in my decision. By using Zola regularly for blogging, I hope to familiarize myself with its codebase. This familiarity could potentially lead to contributing to Zola's open-source project in the future, further enhancing my Rust skills.</li>
<li>It's a SSG (Static Site Generator) which works nicely with Github Pages.</li>
<li>Builds off strong pre-existing tooling such as Hugo, Pelican and Jeykyll.</li>
<li>It uses Tera as its template engine, which has a syntax similar to Jinja2 and Django templates. This familiarity is advantageous, as I have prior experience with both Jinja2 and Django, reducing the learning curve for creating and managing blog templates.</li>
<li>Content written in CommonMark (expanded with some Github flavour via <a href="https://pulldown-cmark.github.io/pulldown-cmark/cheat-sheet.html"><code>pulldown-cmark</code></a>).</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="why-github-pages">Why Github Pages?</h3>
<p>No real thought went into this choice, it was the default. Maybe in the future I will actually
examine other options. This is mainly that it's free, easy and fits easily into my usual
development flows.</p>
<h2 id="conclusion-and-next-steps">Conclusion and Next Steps</h2>
<p>Starting this blog represents a practical step in documenting my work and sharing knowledge. By using Zola and GitHub Pages, I'm balancing the desire to learn new tools with the need for a straightforward, low-maintenance platform.</p>
<p>Moving forward, I plan to focus on:</p>
<ol>
<li>Documenting solutions to specific backend engineering problems I encounter</li>
<li>Sharing brief explanations of useful techniques or patterns from my daily work</li>
<li>Posting occasional updates on my progress with learning Rust and any Zola-related insights</li>
<li>Writing about system design decisions and trade-offs from recent projects</li>
</ol>
<p>I don't have a fixed posting schedule, but I aim to write when I have something concrete and useful to share. The primary goal is to create a resource that's valuable for my future self, with the added benefit of potentially helping others facing similar challenges.</p>
<p>This blog is a work in progress, and its direction may evolve based on what I find most useful and manageable alongside my primary work. If you happen to find something helpful here, all the better.</p>
