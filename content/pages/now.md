Continuing to try and spend more time on hobbies instead of doomsrolling or watching too much YouTube once the work day is over and the kids are put to bed. ~~Not always~~ **Rarely** succeeding.

Current Projects:
* [loxide](https://github.com/sinon/loxide) - Implementing an interpreter for lox language from https://craftinginterpreters.com/ in Rust. At the point of adding support for user defined functions.
* [z2p-axum](https://github.com/sinon/z2p-axum) - Following along with the Zero to Prod book but re-implementing the application in Axum instead of Actix.

Finished:
* [chip8](https://github.com/sinon/chip8) - A [Chip-8](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CHIP-8) interpreter written in no-std Rust.
* [gridlife](https://github.com/sinon/gridlife) - A library for Conways Game of Life in Rust with a TUI to simulate random configurations.
* [pngme](https://github.com/sinon/pngme/) -  Implementation of https://jrdngr.github.io/pngme_book/ which became my go to testing/learning project. Expanded the original with: GUI, Python library binding and crate splitting the project.

On Hold:
* [snake](https://github.com/sinon/snake) - A snake clone TUI built using Ratatui
