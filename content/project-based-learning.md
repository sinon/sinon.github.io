## Why?

Always wanted to learn Rust, several aborted starts.

## The Failed How

A very brief foray pre 1.0 that got to a few simple functions before noping out and returning to the safety of my Python REPL.

The Book Dec 2020

Zero to Prod Oct 2023

Kafka + Rust for a proposal in day job.

A return to the language as tackled Advent of Code in 2023 after an almost 10 year gap, this was more successful but as I had never generally avoided AoC I found myself more entangled in grokking how to approach solving AoC problems than I was with understanding the details of Rust.

Followed by another lull until November 2024, again leveraging AoC as a motivator to spur myself on to do some regular Rust programming.

In the run up to AoC start I was hunting around for some alternatives to work on in the mean time.
